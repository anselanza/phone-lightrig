# phone-lightrig
Turning smartphone flashlights into a remote-controllable lighting rig.

Not complete yet! We've got manual control of the flashlight - both stay on/off controls and intermittent blinking.

Next step is to use http://socket.io/ to do some realtime communication with a NodeJS server for controlling multiple phones remotely.
